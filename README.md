# Pi-Home-Server

Setup a home server using a Raspberry Pi.
## Description

Self-hosting has been always something I would love to have and now it is posible with Docker on a Rpi. You can host multiple applications using docker containers.  All files are served through NGINX, which runs in a wonderful docker container that is used as a reverse proxy with other private access services that are also runinng on the Raspberry: ( Nextcloud, Portainer, Homer, Pi-hole, qBittorrent, Jackettâ€¦).
